## üõ†Ô∏è How it Works
1. **Model Loading**: Loads face-api.js models from `/public/models`.
2. **Webcam Feed**: Uses your webcam (with permission) for live video.
3. **Emotion Detection**: Analyzes your face every second and detects the dominant emotion.
4. **Sound Cue**: Plays a short sound for each new emotion (auto-stops after 5s).
5. **Playlist**: Shows mood-based playlists. Clicking a card plays a random song for that mood.
6. **Music Controls**: Control playback and volume below the emotion console.
7. **Chat/Cursor**: (If enabled) Allows collaborative interaction or chat with other users.
